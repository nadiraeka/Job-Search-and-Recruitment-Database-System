## Job Search and Recruitment Database System Using Python & SQLite

### ðŸ“„ Description
<div align="justify">

This project implements a **Job Search and Recruitment Database System** that simulates a two-sided platform for jobseekers and companies. It features a fully functional **relational database** designed in 3NF, implemented using **SQLite**, and interfaced through a user-friendly GUI in Jupyter Notebook using `ipywidgets`. Users can log in or register accounts, with separate functionalities for jobseekers and companies. Jobseekers can view and update profiles, apply for jobs, view interview schedules, check application results, and update resumes. Companies can post jobs, manage applicants, schedule interviews, and record hiring decisions. The backend database includes tables for accounts, jobs, resumes, qualifications, interviews, and relational bridge tables. SQL commands such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `JOIN`, and `DELETE` are embedded and executed through the Python interface, enabling real-time interaction with the data. This project successfully combines **database design**, **SQL logic**, and **interactive UI** to provide a complete simulation of a recruitment management system.
